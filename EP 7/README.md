# Namaste React ðŸš€ | Learning React Router  

## ðŸ“Œ Today's Learnings  

Today, I explored several important concepts in **React Router** while following the **Namaste React** course by Akshay Saini. These concepts help in building dynamic and structured React applications with efficient navigation.  

## ðŸ”¥ Topics Covered  

- **createBrowserRouter** â€“ Creating a client-side router for navigation.  
- **RouterProvider** â€“ Providing the router configuration to the React app.  
- **Outlet** â€“ A placeholder component that renders child routes.  
- **Children Path in Routes** â€“ Defining nested routes for better structure.  
- **errorElement** â€“ Handling errors gracefully in route components.  
- **useParams Hook** â€“ Accessing dynamic route parameters.  
- **Fetching Data & Displaying Dynamic Content** â€“ Making API calls and rendering dynamic data based on the route.  

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways  

âœ… **Dynamic Routing** â€“ Using `useParams` to get route parameters dynamically.  
âœ… **Nested Routes** â€“ Leveraging `children` paths for structured UI.  
âœ… **Error Handling** â€“ Using `errorElement` to catch and display route errors.  
âœ… **Data Fetching** â€“ Fetching API data based on route parameters to display relevant content.
