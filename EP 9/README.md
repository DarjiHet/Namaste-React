# 🚀 Namaste React - Learning Journey 

<br>

## This repository documents my learning experience from the Namaste React course. Each day, I explore new concepts and deepen my understanding of React and frontend development.
<br>
📌 Today's Learnings 
<br>
1️⃣ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component should have one well-defined purpose.
Improves maintainability and reusability.
<br>
2️⃣ Modularity
Breaking the app into smaller, reusable components.
Keeps code clean and organized.
<br>
3️⃣ Optimizing React Apps
Techniques like memoization, PureComponent, and useMemo/useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Keeping state minimal and localized.
<br>
4️⃣ React Lazy & Suspense
React.lazy() helps in dynamically importing components for better performance.
Suspense lets us handle loading states while fetching lazy-loaded components.-rest785855
